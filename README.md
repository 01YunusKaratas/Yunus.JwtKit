# Yunus.JwtKit  
**JWT + Refresh Token + Cookie-based identity database library (for .NET)**
> Provided as a Plug-and-Play JWT with a focus on Clean Code
> NuGet: [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Yunus.JwtKit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Yunus.JwtKit)

---

##  Purpose
I was tired of rewriting JWT services, interfaces, and cookie management over and over again in every project.
**Yunus.JwtKit** breaks this repetition by offering a secure, simple, and extensible framework without building a token system from scratch.

> Standard JWT solutions are typically only possible with *Access Token* generation.
> JwtKit, on the other hand, provides Refresh Token management, cookie-based registration support,
> and the immortality of ASP.NET Identity.
